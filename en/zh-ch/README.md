# Swoole

?> `Swoole` is a parallel network communication engine based on asynchronous event-driven and coroutine, written in `C++`, providing [coroutine](/coroutine) and [high-performance](/question/use?id=swoole performance how) network programming support for `PHP`. It provides various network server and client modules for multiple communication protocols, making it easy to quickly implement `TCP/UDP services`, `high-performance Web`, `WebSocket services`, `IoT`, `real-time communication`, `games`, `microservices`, etc., breaking the limits of `PHP` in traditional web domains.

## Document Principles

Use straightforward language, **try** to introduce as few technical details of `Swoole` underlying technology as possible and some underlying concepts, which can be maintained in a dedicated 'hack' section later;

When encountering inevitable concepts, **must** have a centralized place to introduce this concept, and link to it from other places. For example: [Event Loop](/learn?id=what-is-eventloop);

When writing documents, shift your thinking, and examine whether others can understand it from a layman's perspective;

When there are feature changes in the future, **must** modify all relevant parts, and not just one;

Each functional module **must** have a complete example.
