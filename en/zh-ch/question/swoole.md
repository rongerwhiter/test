# The Origin and Meaning of the Name of the Swoole Project

## Project Origin

The original idea for the Swoole project came from a previous enterprise software project. It was around the end of 2010, and the company's product had a requirement where users could generate an email address at will, and other users could send emails to this address, with the backend being able to parse the email content into data in real-time and actively notify users. At that time, the project was developed using PHP, and when trying to implement this requirement, a challenge was encountered. PHP could only rely on other SMTP servers, and had to periodically fetch new emails through the POP3 protocol, which was not real-time. To implement a real-time system, it was necessary to write a `TCP Socket Server` to handle the `SMTP` protocol for receiving data. At that time, `PHP` was almost a blank slate in this area, lacking a mature network communication framework. To meet the requirement, I started learning from `sockets` to `TCP/IP`, IO multiplexing, `libevent`, multiple processes, and finally managed to implement this program. After completing this project, I wanted to open-source this program, hoping to help other PHP developers solve challenges in this field. With such a framework, PHP could extend beyond just building simple websites to a larger scope.
## Performance Issues

Another important reason is the performance issues of PHP programs. I originally studied Java and only switched to become a PHP programmer after starting work. During the process of developing programs with PHP, I have always been thinking about the biggest advantage of PHP over Java. It is simple and efficient. After a request is completed, PHP releases all resources and memory, eliminating the worry of memory leaks. Regardless of the quality of the code, it runs smoothly. However, this is also a fatal flaw of PHP. As the number of requests increases and concurrency is high, the rapid creation and immediate release of resources cause a sharp drop in the efficiency of PHP programs. Moreover, as project functionality becomes more complex and the code grows, it becomes a disaster for PHP. This is why PHP frameworks have not been widely accepted by PHP programmers, unlike Java which does not have this problem. Even the best frameworks will be burdened by this inefficient approach, resulting in a slower system. Therefore, I came up with the idea of using PHP to develop a PHP application server, allowing PHP code to be loaded into memory with a longer lifespan, so that established database connections and other large objects are not released. Each request only needs to process a small amount of code, which is compiled by the PHP parser and stored in memory only during the first run. Additionally, what was previously impossible with PHP such as object persistence, database connection pool, and cache connection pool can now be achieved. The system's efficiency will be greatly improved.

After conducting research for a period of time, I have now made initial progress in implementation. I have used PHP itself to write an HTTP server, which runs as an independent server. The execution time of a single program page (involving object generation, database connection, and Smarty template operation) has decreased from the original 0.0x seconds to 0.00x seconds. I tested the server using Apache AB with a concurrency of 100. The Requests Per Second is at least 10 times higher than traditional LAMP setups. On my test machine (Ubuntu 10.04, Intel Core E5300, 2GB memory), Apache only reached 83 RPS, while the Swoole Server surpassed 1150 RPS.

This project is the prototype of Swoole. This version has been continuously maintained for more than 2 years, during which I have gradually accumulated some experience. I now have a deeper understanding of the problems with this technical solution, such as poor performance, many restrictions preventing direct calls to the operating system interfaces, and inefficient memory management.
## Joining Tencent

At the end of 2011, I joined Tencent and was responsible for the PHP platform development work of QQ Friends. I was amazed to find that my colleagues at QQ Friends not only thought about this, but they actually implemented it. The QQ Friends team had already been using this solution in the production environment. QQ Friends had three main components: the first one was PWS, a WebServer written purely in PHP. More than 600 servers at QQ Friends were running on PWS, without using programs like Apache or PHP-FPM. The second was SAPS, a distributed queue developed in PHP. At that time, about 150 servers were running this cluster, handling logic such as image clipping, avatar processing, synchronous messaging, and data synchronization asynchronously using SAPS. The third was PSF, a PHP-based server framework. Many of QQ Friends' logic layer servers were based on PSF implementation. Around 300 servers were running PSF server programs. During my time at QQ Friends, I learned a lot about Linux foundations and network communication. I gained a lot of experience in network communication tracking and debugging in large-scale cluster high-concurrency environments, which laid a solid foundation for developing Swoole.
## Developing Swoole

During this period, I also learned and understood excellent technical solutions such as Node.js and Golang, which gave me more inspiration. In 2012, I had a new idea and decided to use C language to re-implement a version with stronger performance and more powerful features. This is the current Swoole extension.

Now Swoole has been used by many PHP technical teams for actual project development work, both domestically and internationally. In China, well-known users include Baidu Order Center, Baidu Maps, Tencent QQ Public Account and Enterprise QQ, Douyu Live, 360, Dangdang, Qyer, etc. In addition, many IoT, hardware, and game projects are also using Swoole. Additionally, there are more and more open-source frameworks based on Swoole, such as TSF, Blink, and swPromise, etc. You can also find many Swoole-related projects and code on GitHub.
## Name Origin

The name "Swoole" is not an English word. It is a homophonic word I created. Initially, I thought of naming it "sword-server," symbolizing creating a sharp sword for PHP developers. Later, as I thought about how Google was also a made-up name, I decided to name it "Swoole."
