# Swoole Client

This section includes all clients provided by Swoole, including synchronous blocking clients and coroutine clients. Swoole 4 no longer supports asynchronous clients, and the corresponding requirements can be completely replaced by coroutine clients. [Reference](/learn?id=synchronous-io-asynchronous-io).
